# Game of Life

John Conway's game of Life - learning exercises by Roland Waddilove. Original idea: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life

### Python versions of Life

**Game of Life 8.py**: A text app that runs in the terminal window.

**Game of Life 10 GUI.py**: Same code, but outputs to a Python Turtle graphical window.

### Java version of LIfe

**LifeGame.java**: I'm taking a break from Python to learn Java. Here is the Game of Life in Java. While writing it, I realised I was using a slow and cumbersome method in the Python version. This is a better version, at least until I update the Python version. (Not a priority.)

Both are text-based and run in a terminal window. Both are source code, so load them into your favourite editor and run them from there.
